TODO:
- Don't need to store Epsilon and Epsilon2 for uniform layers
- Document the non-public functions in here
- Remove some commented out junk debugging code
- Figure out what is wrong with Lanczos smoothing (is there anything wrong?)
- Choose Lanczos values more intelligently

- 1D lattices should have Fourier transforms which depend only on the intersection of each shape with the x-axis (line segments).
